Time inversted: about 1 week.

This project uses the method [The Turk](https://medium.com/@ayogun/push-swap-c1f5d2d41e97). 

It works well and stably.

The most complicated part is to find the cheapest number and to implement the best solution for the number.

Algo could be optimised but this program works well enough.

Kinda proud of myself for having finished this.
